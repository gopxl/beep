// Resample takes a Streamer which is assumed to stream at the old sample rate and returns a
// Streamer, which streams the data from the original Streamer resampled to the new sample rate.
//
// This is, for example, useful when mixing multiple Streamer with different sample rates, either
// through a beep.Mixer, or through a speaker. Speaker has a constant sample rate. Thus, playing
// Streamer which stream at a different sample rate will lead to a changed speed and pitch of the
// playback.

// The quality argument specifies the quality of the resampling process. Higher quality implies
// worse performance. Values below 1 or above 64 are invalid and Resample will panic. Here's a table
// for deciding which quality to pick.
//
//	quality | use case
//	--------|---------
//	1       | very high performance, on-the-fly resampling, low quality
//	3-4     | good performance, on-the-fly resampling, good quality
//	6       | higher CPU usage, usually not suitable for on-the-fly resampling, very good quality
//	>6      | even higher CPU usage, for offline resampling, very good quality
//
// Sane quality values are usually below 16. Higher values will consume too much CPU, giving
// negligible quality improvements.
